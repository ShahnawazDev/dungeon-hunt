## Inspiration  
Dungeon Hunt was inspired by the thrill of treasure hunts and puzzle-solving games. The goal was to create a fun, kid-friendly game that combines simple mechanics with intriguing challenges.  

## Features  
- 2D platformer gameplay  
- 4 levels of increasing difficulty  
- Collect fruits while avoiding traps like spikes, spinning saws, and fire  
- Explore hidden pathways and use movable blocks and moving platforms  
- Simple and intuitive UI designed for kids  

## How to Play  
1. Launch the game on a web browser using a keyboard-enabled device.  
2. Navigate the player using these controls:  
   - **Right Arrow Key / D**: Move right  
   - **Left Arrow Key / A**: Move left  
   - **Up Arrow Key / W / Spacebar**: Jump  
3. Collect as many fruits as possible while avoiding traps and solving puzzles.  
4. Reach the finish line to complete the level.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Unity**: Game development  
- **C#**: Scripting language for player movement and game mechanics  
- **Amazon Q Developer**: For code generation, optimization, and debugging Unity scripts  
- **Amazon Amplify**: For deploying and hosting the web-based game  

## Challenges  
1. Setting up **Amazon Q Developer** with **Visual Studio 2022** was challenging due to compatibility and configuration issues.  
2. Debugging and fine-tuning player movement and interaction mechanics as Unity and C# were new to us.  
3. Learning and troubleshooting **Amazon Amplify** workflows for hosting and deployment.  
4. Time constraints prevented us from implementing a leaderboard or score-storing system.  

## Future Plans  
- Add a leaderboard to track player scores.  
- Expand the game with more levels and new challenges.  
- Introduce additional features like multiplayer modes or dynamic weather effects.  
- Optimize the game for mobile devices.
